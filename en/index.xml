      My name is Victor. I currently work as a senior backend developer in the fintech sector. I have also worked in health cloud and several other fields.
I am finishing my degree in Cyber Defense, a subject that has always interested me and continues to fascinate me. I constantly seek to deepen my knowledge in this area, especially alongside programming.
On this blog, you will find content related to software development, pentesting, reverse engineering, malware analysis, among many other topics. This is also a personal space where I occasionally post about things I enjoy that are not necessarily related to technology.
